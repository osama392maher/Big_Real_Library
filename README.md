Big_Real is a C++ class that can hold a real number with unlimited number of digits (no minimum or maximum boundries) and supports math functions between Big_Reals.

This library needs another library to make composition of another class called "Big_Decimal_Int" which can hold an integer number with unlimited digits, [we created this library before](https://github.com/osama392maher/Big_Int_Assignment)..   
But to practice working with other programmers' code, we used a "Big_Decimal_Int" library that was written by another team 

## The class has the following features:
* Addition with other BigReal-s ( + operator ) 
* Subtraction with other BigReal-s ( - operator ) 
* Comparing with another BigReal ( < , > , = ) operators
* Assigning BigReal to another BigReal
* Using input and output streams with BigReal-s
* Initalizing the BigReal from different data types (BigDecimalInt, int, double, etc..)

## The Goal of this project is to:
* Practice Object-Oriented-Programming concepts using C++ (Encapsulation - Abstraction - Composition - etc..) 
* Practice building systems using OOP modeling and design with C++
* Practice working in a team and integrating the code together to come up with a final working program
* Practice working and using another library that wasn't written you, and using its public interface efficiently to complete our project
